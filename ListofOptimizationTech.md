Optimization Techniques for CUDA 2D Histogram
Use Shared Memory for Histogram Updates


Reduces global memory contention by accumulating updates in shared memory before committing them to global memory.
This minimizes the number of slow atomicAdd() operations.
Optimize Thread Block and Grid Dimensions


Choosing an optimal block size (e.g., 32x8) ensures efficient warp execution and maximizes parallelism.
This improves GPU utilization and reduces thread divergence.
Minimize Memory Transfers Between Host and Device


Use pinned (page-locked) memory (cudaMallocHost()) for faster memory transfers.
Use asynchronous memory transfers (cudaMemcpyAsync()) to overlap computation with data transfers.
Coalesced Global Memory Access


Organize memory access patterns so threads access consecutive global memory locations.
Improves memory bandwidth efficiency and reduces latency.
Reduce Atomic Contention Using Warp-Level Primitives (__shfl_down_sync())


Instead of each thread calling atomicAdd(), use warp-level reductions to minimize contention.
Reduces serialization overhead and improves performance.
Minimize Warp Divergence


Avoid if-else conditions inside warps by using boolean masks and predicated execution.
Ensures all threads in a warp execute uniformly, maximizing throughput.
Profile and Tune Performance with CUDA Tools (nvprof, Nsight Compute)


Identify bottlenecks in memory access, computation, and execution using profiling tools.
Optimize kernel configurations based on hardware-specific characteristics.
