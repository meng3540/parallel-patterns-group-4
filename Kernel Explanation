<red>CUDA Kernel Explanation</red>

The compute2DHistogram kernel is designed to compute a 2D histogram based on the 
intensity and gradient magnitude of a grayscale image. This kernel is launched 
with a grid of thread blocks, where each thread is responsible for processing a 
pixel from the image. The grid and block dimensions are calculated in the main 
function to ensure that all pixels are covered efficiently.

Step 1: Identifying the Pixel's Position

Each thread calculates its unique position (x, y) in the image grid using the formulas:

int x = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
int y = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;

These calculations are crucial since CUDA processes data in parallel, and each 
thread must identify its corresponding pixel. The subsequent boundary condition 
check:

if (x >= width || y >= height) return;

It sures that threads attempting to access pixels outside the image dimensions exit safely, preventing memory errors.

Step 2: Computing Gradients

The kernel calculates horizontal (gx) and vertical (gy) gradients using the Sobel operator. The Sobel operator is a convolution filter commonly used for edge detection. The logic applied here is:

gx = image[(y - 1) * width + (x + 1)] - image[(y - 1) * width + (x - 1)]
    + 2 * image[y * width + (x + 1)] - 2 * image[y * width + (x - 1)]
    + image[(y + 1) * width + (x + 1)] - image[(y + 1) * width + (x - 1)];

This calculation combines pixel intensity differences in both horizontal and vertical directions, emphasizing edge changes.

Step 3: Computing Magnitude and Binning

The gradient magnitude is calculated as follows:

float gradientMagnitude = sqrtf(gx * gx + gy * gy);

This represents the strength of the gradient at each pixel. The gradient magnitude is then mapped to a specific bin:

int gradientBin = min(numBins - 1, (int)(gradientMagnitude / (255.0 / numBins)));

This ensures that gradient values are appropriately categorized into predefined bin ranges.

The intensity bin is determined by dividing the pixel intensity by the number of bins:

int intensityBin = image[y * width + x] / (256 / numBins);

This effectively maps the pixel's intensity to its respective bin for histogram generation.

Step 4: Updating the Histogram

To ensure safe parallel writes, the code uses an atomic operation:

atomicAdd(&histogram[intensityBin * pitch + gradientBin], 1);

The atomicAdd function ensures that multiple threads increment the same histogram bin safely without race conditions, maintaining accurate counts.

Overall Functionality

This kernel efficiently calculates the 2D histogram by combining intensity and gradient data, allowing for detailed image analysis. By leveraging CUDA's parallel capabilities, this method is optimized for large-scale image processing tasks where performance is crucial.
