Understanding Parallel Patterns and the Role of GPU-CPU Computing


Parallel patterns have structured patterns in computing that split the execution of the task, enabling that simultaneously runs this so as to give it efficient performance and productivity because it would
address with parallelized task implementations and data parallelism in which fully functioning different parts of a dataset at the same time. Most importantly, those patterns are put into methods such as imaging
processing, simulation, or big data analytics for fast computation across multiple processors/cores acting upon separate parts of a problem.

Heterogeneous GPU-CPU computing represents the extreme end of this parallelism. Its beauty is mainly due to a combination of very different strengths, that is, a general-purpose GPU used alongside a general-purpose
CPU. Whereas, Simple repetitive operations can also be taken by the GPUs, thus making it good at handling enormous numbers of operations at the same time as data-parallel problems. Sequential, very complex operations
will better be done by a CPU. Allocating different parts of the problem to the most appropriate processor increases performance. Thus, one could easily argue that it mostly occurs during machine learning, where you 
can use the power of GPUs for massive data training in parallel and accomplish with complex preprocessing or decision-making with CPUs.
